# Overview
In this module, you will configure Amplify to host the static resources for your web application with continuous deployment built in. The Amplify Console provides a git-based workflow for continuous deployment and hosting of full-stack web apps. In subsequent modules, you will add dynamic functionality using JavaScript to call remote RESTful APIs built with Lambda and API Gateway.
